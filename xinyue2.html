          <h1>My name is Xinyue Li. I am a design major student who is studying at San Jose State University. I am listing this basic information is not try to make you think I am only a designer or an artist. What I want to say is that I am a student. As more artists and information I learned about visual art, I feel that I probably will be a student for the rest of life. Because there are always new things to learn. Currently, I know Illustrator and Photoshop more than Indesign and Premiere. I do a lot of personal works through  Photoshop in my first year at college, then I begin to use illustrator after that. Every time, When I want to make a new thing, I always go outside, look around, or talk with friends. It’s hard for me to have good ideas through only sitting inside, I always need to experience and then “something” in the experience can inspire me will give me good ideas. Then I will list all the ideas on a paper and do several sketches for the drafts. Dream sometimes also helps me to get good ideas. Getting more sleep is one of my choices when I face troubles.
I like to design. When a place has been long enough, there is a tension between the way it was originally designed and what it is. Using glitch or other treatments will give the already tired feelings a new look. Or show the wonderful dreams made last night with video or GIF.
What do I want to say with art?
Express your emotions: weird, cute, ordinary but different. Whether it is negative or positive. I hope that those who read my work can enjoy the beauty they bring.

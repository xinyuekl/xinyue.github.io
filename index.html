      <h3>“FOX girl", Glitch Art Project, 2019</h3>
      <p>The original picture is a girl and a fox. I like the fox very much, so this is why I chose this picture. I
changed the frequency of music from this picture by using auditory, and I always got the effect of
"Glitch".</p>

  <h3>“Free or Fly”, Composite Art Project, 2019</h3>
  <p>I really like the blue moon and everything about the ocean. The small island prison
on the coast of San Francisco in the original picture has a mysterious and dark
atmosphere. By using Photoshop, I added flying fish and a mermaid sitting on a
swan and a blue moon to express my understanding of "freedom."</p>

  <h3>“flower bloom in the ocean”, Audio/Video Art Project, 2019</h3>
  <p>I superimposed the video of the cherry blossom recording and the sea video. The
background music is the sound of the shower I sprayed on the palm of my hand. I
added echo effects through audacity. The feeling that I want to bring to the viewer
is bright and depressed.</p>

  <h3>“a butterfly, a dream”, Net Art Project, 2019</h3>
  <p>I dreamed that I became a butterfly. Dancing in the colorful flowers, when I woke
up, I suddenly lost my mind: I am me? Or am I a butterfly?</p>

  <h3>“chasing point butterfly", Code as Art Project,2019</h3>
  <p>“What do we really want to pursue? The original intention at the beginning, or the fascinating prosperity in front of us?”
Butterfly: fame and name
orange dot: original intention

black dot: us

Gray dot: nothing last</p>

  <h3>"the story in lines and shapes.", Final Project,2019</h3>
  <p>Lines are the basis for many figurative things. Whether it is a strong artistic work or simple daily necessities.
I will show my thoughts by painting, editing videos, etc. There may be some glitch photos at the beginning.
I really like the work of Mark Napier, Mark tribe, Anne marie schleiner. Their works contain a lot of line elements.
Lines play an important role in their work.
I also would like to express my emotion through various versions of combinations with lines and shapes.</p>
